 *     kevincostinger.js - 100p.
 *
 *     This is Kevin. Kevin keeps track of your expenses
 *     and costs. To add an expense, pick a date, declare
 *     the amount and add a short description.
 *
 *     When you submit the form, all fields are validated.
 *     If Kevin is not happy with your inputs, the least
 *     he will do is, bring you back to the field where
 *     you made a mistake. But who knows? Maybe he can
 *     even provide some excellent User experience?
 *     (+5 Bonus points available
 *
 *     These are the rules for the form validation:
 *      - Date is valid, if it's not empty.
 *      - Amount is valid, if it's at least 0.01.
 *      - Text is valid, if it's at least 3 letters long.
 *
 *     If everything is okay, Kevin adds a new table row,
 *     containing the expense. The table row also contains
 *     a button, which deletes the expense, once you click
 *     it. After adding a table row, the form is reset and
 *     ready for the next input.
 *
 *     At the bottom of the expense tracker, you can see
 *     a small number. It represents the sum of all expenses,
 *     which are currently tracked. It is always accurate!
 *
 *     Have a look at the pictures provided. They demonstrate
 *     how the software looks like. Notice the details, like
 *     the perfectly formatted currency! Isn't that great?
 *
 *     By the way...
 *     Kevin is a clean guy. He is free of code duplications.
 *     Kevin defines his quality by using functions and
 *     events, to keep his sourcecode clean af. He understands
 *     the scope of his variables and of course, makes use of
 *     event delegation, to keep his event listeners tidied up!
